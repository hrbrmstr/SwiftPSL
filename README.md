# SwiftPSL

A Swift wrapper for [`libpsl`](https://github.com/rockdaboot/libpsl) to work with internet domains in the context of the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).

Primarily created as an example Swift wrapper for an ultra-simple C library

### TODO

- enable extraction of host, subdomain, domain, and public suffix
